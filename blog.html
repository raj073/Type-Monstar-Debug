    <h3><b>1. Difference between local storage and session storage?</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p> <i> <strong> Explanation: </strong></i>
    <article>localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or
      the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
      sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
      browser is
      open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.
    </article>
    <article>
      The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data
      is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
      whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.

    <h3><b>2. Difference between global scope and block scope in javascript?</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p> <i> <strong>Explanation: </strong></i>
    <article>
      <strong>Function Scope: </strong> When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that
      function and
      cannot be
      used outside that function. <br> <strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch
      conditions or
      inside for
      or
      while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.
    </article>
    <article>
      Basically, the difference between function scope and block scope is that in a language that uses function scope,
      any
      variables declared within a function are visible anywhere within that same function. But with block scope, the
      visibility of variables is confined to any given block (whether it's an if statement, where/for loop, etc)
      enclosed by
      curly braces.

    <h3><b>3. How does javascript event loop work?</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p><i><strong>Explanation: </strong></i></p>
    <article>
      The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task
      is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any
      other tasks that need to be performed.
    </article>
    <article>
      It is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to
      the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available
      callbacks. If
      there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same
      process.

    <h3><b>4. In what cases we can get undefined value is Javascript?</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p> <i> <strong> Explanation: </strong></i>
    <article>
      The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value or not declared at all.
    </article>
    <article>
      When a variable has no value assigned, then we can get undefined value from that varibale. If a function is
      declared without any return or only a return keyword without value then we also get undefined here. Any operation
      like adding, multiply etc with the
      value of
      undefined with give the result undefined. In any object if there we access a property which is not present, this
      will
      give undefined. Array out of index value or accessing array value which is deleted already will provide undefined
